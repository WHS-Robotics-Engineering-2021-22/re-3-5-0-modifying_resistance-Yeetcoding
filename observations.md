All of the circuts use the same resistors, but use them differently. The first circut is using the resistors separately, they just share the same power source. The second circut  
has a current of .05 mA, and it combines the two resistors, therfore increasing the resistance and decreasing the current. The last circut has the two resistors, and they 
both habe the same power source and ground. But it's current measures in at .24 mA. This circut divides the current, giving the electrons 2 different paths. The relation between 
resistance and current is direct, because the more resistance there is, the slower the current will be. This is somewhat similar to a river flowing. 
The reason for using resistors in series is because if you do, you can add up the resistance in a current.
